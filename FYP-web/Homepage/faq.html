              Freshmen leader (FL) is one of the roles in the whole fyp series.
              FLs are basically the first people freshmen will interact with
              during orientation. For about a week, FLs will help guide and lead
              freshmen to adjust to college life, understand and apply binus
              core values (like BGA, SPIRIT, etc.), and make sure everything
              runs smoothly during orientation.

              There's a bunch of perks you get if you join as an FL or FP.
              Things like certificates, SAT points (for FL), community service
              points (for FP), and of course a lot of soft skills you'll develop
              from the experience. you'll also get a lanyard, t-shirt (for FL),
              and exclusive apparel (for FP) that looks super cool. That's it?
              Nopeee, you'll also get free parking during your time as an FL or
              FP. Pretty nice right?

              If you wanna sign up, just go to freshmen.apps.binus.ac.id (if
              it's slow or error try incognito or a different browser). Then go
              to 'student registration' and make sure the role at the top is set
              to 'freshmen chaperone'. Don't forget to click 'search'. Scroll
              down and you'll see the open recruitment poster for FL and FP,
              read it to check the requirements. Then scroll a bit more and
              you'll see the personal info form. Fill that honestly, choose the
              role you want (FL or FP), and upload your CV.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once everything's filled, double-check and just hit submit. Don't
              forget to pick your interview schedule in the 'schedule selection'
              menu. If you're applying for both FL and FP, choose the same
              schedule twice and don't forget to change the role each time to FL
              and FP. You can still reschedule later if needed. After that,
              you'll be contacted or added to a candidate group by your
              department's FYPL.

              The selection usually starts about a week after registration
              opens. Once you've signed up, you'll be invited to a group by your
              department's FYPL, and they'll give you all the details about the
              interview schedule, room, and technical stuff. If you've chosen
              your interview slot, just show up on time and at the right place.
              after the interview, you'll need to wait for the results which
              will be reviewed by SSO and your department—it might take about
              1-2 months. the results will be sent to your BINUS email, so keep
              checking it!

              The “mentor” here is a different role that offered by BINUS, usually
              for 1 semester. you can read more about it at:
              support.binus.ac.id/article/mentor-tutor-duta-binusian if you're
              interested in that too, you can click 'yes'. don't worry, it won't
              affect your fl/fp interview result. we're just curious hehe.

              Yup, totally can. Even if you're interning, you still need to lead
              the eese 2 sessions (which happens while you're interning), but
              eese 2 meetings are not as intense or frequent as EESE 1. As for
              example, you might only need to do a session once every 1-3 weeks,
              compared to weekly meetings in EESE 1. You'll just need to come to
              campus to check in manually for each session.

              The main difference is the timing of your duties. FL works during
              orientation until inauguration, while FP is active throughout the
              excellent program—around a year during the freshmen's 1st and 2nd
              semesters. the job is different too—FLs help manage freshmen and
              make sure the orientation events run well. Usually, you'll be
              assigned to a class along with other FLs and help guide freshmen
              during that week. FPs, on the other hand, are more like mentors
              during the whole academic year. You'll help your class throughout
              the excellent program, guide them during uni life, and be their
              go-to person. Benefits are also different—FPs get community
              service points, while fls get sat points.

              New student experience & transition (NEXT), which used to be
              called 'otp', will be held from August 18 to 27, then followed by
              academic experience and inauguration on september 4. So only one
              batch of next this year? yup, next is gonna be held in just one
              batch, but don't worry it's still gonna be super fun and full of
              experience. FLs will be the ones leading it, so if you're planning
              to be an FL, make sure your schedule is free from august to
              September, okay?
